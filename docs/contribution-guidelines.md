Bitcoin PR governance
> “Decision Making” Process
    The following applies to code changes to the Bitcoin Core project (and related projects such as libsecp256k1), and is not to be confused with overall Bitcoin Network
    Protocol consensus changes.
> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge maintainers and ultimately the project lead.
> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will judge
the general consensus of contributors. -->
