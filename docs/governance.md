- [Bitcoin](https://bitcoincore.org/en/faq/contributing-code/)
- Notes: Bitcoin, one of the most popular open source projects in the world has only seen ~560 [contributors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors), 50 of whom who have sizeable contributions. This leads me to believe that governance should be made simple and effective for more intimate participation



## Notes
Loki governance
> The risk of weak, informally defined governance has been studied extensively throughout the history of blockchain technology. Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced contentious hard forks that split the focus and efforts of their respective communities. Although hard forks can be used as a governance strategy, they should always be considered as a last resort rather than the solution to every contentious issue. The Loki governance system is designed to resolve potential issues by providing a structured environment for discourse and representation, and also to source funding for the development of Loki without reliance on external influence or altruism.
